-------------------HOW TO TRIGGER-------------------------------------
First wait for an OreBlob to appear. The world event is prevented from
occuring while OreBlobs are not present. This is due to the nature of
their behavior change.

Clicking anywhere after an OreBlob appears will trigger the world
event.

-------------------WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EVENT IS TRIGGERED---------------
When the world event is triggered Portals will appear in a grid
pattern around the location of the mouse click. Attacker entities will
appear on top or underneath the portals.

Tiles around the portals will change to be covered in broken bottles.
Grass background tiles will become grass broken bottle tiles and dirt
tiles will become dirt broken bottle tiles.

The OreBlobs will change their target and appearance.

-------------------WHAT AFFECTED ENTITES DO---------------------------
The world event will cause the OreBlobs to change into AttackMode and
their color will change from green to red.

The target of the OreBlobs will also change from Veins to Attackers.

Lastly their Death animation will change in appearance from green to
red.

-------------------WHAT THE NEW ENTITY IS-----------------------------
Two new entities where added.
The FIRST new entity is the static entity Death. Death replaced the
Quake class.

The SECOND new entity is the mobile entity Attacker.

-------------------HOW DOES THE NEW ENETIY BEHAVE---------------------
The Death entity allows for multiple types of entities to preform a
death sequence.

Veins keep their same Quake sequence. The Attackers (robot Rick or
lazy programmer, you decide) also shared the same vein death sequence.
The OreBlobs have two different imageStores for their different modes.
Red OreBlob death or Green OreBlob death.

The Attacker entity targets OreBlobs and when they are adjacent will
try to destroy them.

-------------------TESTING NOTES--------------------------------------
1. The Attacker entity in the upper left corner will start to move
when an OreBlob appears.
This serves two purposes.
    a. This is to show that the World Event, and not the existence of
       Attackers, triggers the change in OreBlob behavior. Which again
       is changing targets from Veins to Attackers.
    b. Show the change in appearance of the Green OrbBlob Death
       sequence.

2. Waiting to click until an OreBlob appears can result in missing the
observation of a Green OrbBlob behavior and their Death sequence. So,
click early to allow viewport navigation of the world map without
triggering the world event.

3. Two good tests to run:
    a. Clicking far away from an OreBlob early in the game so the
       Attackers and OreBlobs need to navigate a long distance before
       meeting.
    b. Clicking on the lake area to see the difference between grass
       and dirt tile transformations. This also shows that Attackers
       cannot spawn on obstacles.

-------------------TO DOS----------------------------------------------
1. Refactor Attacker class and OreBlob class. They share a lot of
similarity and could both become children of the a parent Attacker
class.

2. Some OreBlobs remain Green when attacking. I believe this has
something to due with the time it take the Ores to become OreBlobs.
It seems to occur when an Ore that was created before the world event
becomes an OreBlob after the world event.

-------------------FUTURE FEATURES-------------------------------------
1. When Attackers are destroyed their portals should close.
2. Attacker death sequence should be unique
3. When no attackers exist OreBlobs should either target Miners or
Veins
4. Add health to OreBlobs and Attackers for longer entity existence
5. Add fight sequence to Attackers and OreBlobs
6. Add Ore to OreBlob transformation sequence
